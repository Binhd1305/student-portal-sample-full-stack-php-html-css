 We want to create an application that can be used to track student information at Metropolitan community college. The tables that we want to track are courses, grades, & attendance. The purpose of the application is for the client to better organize student information and the success of its students. The scope of the application will just be the courses the student is enrolled in, their attendance, and their grades in those courses. We will first make the entity relationship diagram, then export that diagram to a create script in SQL, insert data into the tables, and then use PHP, HTML, & CSS to build the web application for the user to edit, delete, and update the database. When you open the application, you will see a table of the students, their class schedules, grades, and attendance. The user can update the data in the tables like changing a course or changing a grade.
